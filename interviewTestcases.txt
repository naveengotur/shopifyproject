Bug Report
1.Inconsistent Behavior During Signup:
When clicking the ‚ÄúStart your free trial‚Äù button during signup, the application sometimes unexpectedly prompts for additional information before showing the "Start your free trial" popup.

2.Login Flow Issue:
After entering login credentials, users are sometimes redirected to an information form before being taken to the ‚ÄúChoose a Plan‚Äù page. This disrupts the expected login flow.

3.Login Unreliability:
Users are experiencing difficulty logging in to the application. The login process is inconsistent and not user-friendly.

4.Automation Login Challenges:
Manual login works as expected, but logging in through automation scripts proves to be difficult due to unpredictable redirects and prompts.

5.Homepage Not Loading After Login:
Even after entering valid login credentials, the homepage does not load. Instead, the user is stuck on a page that only displays a URL match notification without progressing further.

Automation Report Note
Sign-Up Test Scripts:
1.If the login fails due to an unexpected prompt before the ‚ÄúStart your free trial‚Äù popup, execute the login1 test script.
2.If the login redirects to an information form and then shows the ‚ÄúChoose a Plan‚Äù page, run the login2 test script.

Login Test Script:
1.If the signup flow fails completely, skip directly to the login process by executing the login3 test script.
